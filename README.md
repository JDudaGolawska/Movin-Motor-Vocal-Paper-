# MovinMotorVocal Paper
This repository contains the Matlab code used in the study by Duda-Goławska & Laudańska, investigating how vocalisations are coupled with movements of all limbs throughout infancy

# Data
The data that support the findings will be available upon request from the corresponding authors following an embargo from the date of publication to allow for finalization of the ongoing longitudinal project.

**Snipplets**

Here there a series of functions that are called from the main script:
