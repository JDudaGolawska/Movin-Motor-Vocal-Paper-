# MovinMotorVocal Paper
This repository contains the Matlab code used in the study by Duda-Goławska & Laudańska, investigating how vocalisations are coupled with movements of all limbs throughout infancy

# Data
The data supporting the findings will be available upon request from the corresponding authors following an embargo from the date of publication to allow for the finalization of the ongoing longitudinal project. 

# Scripts

**Main Script**

- run_MotoVocal.m -> controls the whole process of analysis. The script loads the data from one of the 3 tasks and preprocess/processes the data.

- structure and functions from eeglab (2023) were used to store accelerometer data.
